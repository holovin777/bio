A career shaped by resilience, adaptability, and more plot twists than a Netflix drama. It all started deep undergroundâ€”in a Ukrainian coal mine, where the Wi-Fi was nonexistent, but the determination was at full signal strength.

After studying mining engineering at the Mining and Economic College in Chervonohrad, I continued with a Masterâ€™s degree from the Dnipro University of Technologyâ€”while working in a mine, because who doesnâ€™t love a challenge? Then life decided to throw a few unexpected upgrades: first, emigration to Sweden (complete with a stay in a refugee camp, a truly immersive survival experience), then deportation to Poland, where I became an installer of electronic security systemsâ€”because apparently, moving between countries wasnâ€™t enough excitement.

Italy soon became home, bringing a variety of jobs: steward at San Siro stadium (watching the game while pretending to focus on crowd control), installing industrial heating systems, operating thermal deburring machines (fancy words for making metal look smooth), working as an electromechanic and a welder, and later, cutting tubes with laser precision (because sparks are cool).

Then came another unexpected plot twistâ€”a cycling accident, followed by a brain tumor diagnosis. Cue surgery, rehabilitation, and speech therapy. But giving up? Not an option.

Now, as a Maintenance Technician at EOS Engineering & Consulting and a DevOps enthusiast, the focus is on keeping machines running, solving complex technical puzzles, and making everything more efficientâ€”ideally without causing unexpected explosions (but hey, letâ€™s not rule anything out).

From the depths of coal mines to high-tech maintenance and the exciting chaos of DevOps, every step has been a lesson in perseverance, problem-solving, and embracing the unexpected.

And the best part? The journey is just getting started. ðŸš€
